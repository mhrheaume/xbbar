xbbar, (c) 2013 Matthew Rheaume
===============================

A minimal screen brightness adjustment bar for X. Useful for desktop
environments that do not include any kind of brightness adjusting tool (XMonad,
Awesome, etc).

Requirements
------------
In order to build xbbar you need:
- libX11
- libxpb (https://www.github.com/mhrheaume/libxpb)

Installation
------------
Enter the following command to build and install xbbar (if necessary as root):

	make clean install

Running
-------
- Use XK_MonBrightnessUp, Up, or K to increase brightness.
- Use XK_MonBrightnessDown, Down, or J to decrease brightness.
- Exit with ESC.
- Run 'xbbar -h' to see options.

Notes
-----
- Since this program modifies the sysfs brightness files, it will probably need
  to be run as root.
- You may also need LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS=/usr/local/lib if libxpb has been
  installed to the default location.
